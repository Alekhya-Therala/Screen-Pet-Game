# Screen-Pet-Game
The Screen Pet Game is a Python-based interactive desktop application that displays a virtual pet on the screen. The pet reacts to user interactions and changes its expressions based on mouse actions and inactivity, making the game fun and engaging.

Features that our Screen Pet Game will perform:

Happy Face: When you click on the screen pet using the mouse, it blushes and displays a happy expression.

Cheeky Face: When you double-click on the screen pet, it sticks out its tongue and shows a cheeky expression.

Sad Face: When the screen pet is ignored for a period of time, it becomes sad. Clicking on it again makes the pet happy.
